# Notes for Missing Semesters
The purpose of these notes are to give a brief overview and functionalities of all the commands taught in the course(during the "Independent Activities Period‚Äù in January 2020) along with some handful theoretical topics.

If you haven't watched the missing semester [playlist](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLyzOVJj3bHQuloKGG59rS43e29ro7I57J) by MIT, I would highly recommend it. The course provides the necessary introduction to various concepts in CS curriculum which aren't generally taught in classes.
