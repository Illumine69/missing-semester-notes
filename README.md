# Notes for Missing Semesters
The purpose of these notes are to give a brief overview and functionalities of all the commands taught in the course along with some handful theoretical topics.

If you haven't watched the missing semester [playlist](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLyzOVJj3bHQuloKGG59rS43e29ro7I57J) by MIT, I would highly recommend it. The course provided me the necessary introduction to various concepts in CS curriculum which aren't generally taught in classes.
